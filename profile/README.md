## üöÄ Highlights & Impact:

### üéØ Mission  
We‚Äôre here to empower individuals around the world ‚Äì through grassroots, open-source Bitcoin education. We believe this is the path to a freer, more self-reliant future, where people truly understand money, sovereignty, and how to take control of their own financial lives.

### üéì Bitcoin Diploma ‚Äì 2025  
Our [flagship 10-week program](https://github.com/MyFirstBitcoin/Bitcoin-Diploma-2025), implemented across the globe, is 100% open source. We start with the basics: What is money? How did we get here? Why is Bitcoin different ‚Äì and what does it actually solve? From monetary history to the technology and societal implications of Bitcoin, the Diploma gives learners the tools to think critically and understand Bitcoin's role in shaping a better future.

### ü§ù Community Engagement  
Alongside our monthly [Bitcoin Meetups](https://lu.ma/myfirstbitcoin) in San Salvador, we also host casual weekly Bitcoin meetups every Tuesday in San Salvador, each time in a different restaurant, caf√©, or local venue ‚Äì open to all.

Through these efforts, we‚Äôve connected and educated over 40,000 individuals through our Bitcoin Diploma classes, workshops, meetups, and online courses. The community is at the heart of everything we do.

### üåç Global Reach  
Through our independent and fast-growing [Node Network](https://myfirstbitcoin.io/node-network-dashboard/) ‚Äì active in over 36 countries with 64 projects ‚Äì we bring Bitcoin education to classrooms, community centers, and institutions from Central America to South Africa, Southeast Asia, and beyond.

## üèõÔ∏è Former Collaboration with Ministry of Education & Bitcoin Office  
As of April 2025, we are no longer part of any active programs with the Ministry of Education (MINED) or The Bitcoin Office in El Salvador. We are deeply thankful for the opportunity to have contributed to the early development of Bitcoin education in public schools.

Today, MINED and The Bitcoin Office have taken the lead in the public school sector, while we refocus even more on grassroots efforts ‚Äì working directly with anyone who wants to teach Bitcoin, supporting our global community through our decentralized and independent Node Network.

Bitcoin is constantly evolving; and so are we.
